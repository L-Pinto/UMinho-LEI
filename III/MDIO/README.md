***About*** : These projects consisted in resolving several problems using fundamental principles of operation research.

- The first project consisted in finding the shortest path for a drone to travel by using the concept of eulerian circuit and graph.  

- The second project consisted in removing the ideal amount of blocks to from a mine (considering its cost and profit) by using the concept of maximum-weight or minimum-weight closure in a graph.  

- The third project consisted in planning efficiently the execution of a project through reducing the time of some activities by using the concept of mixed-integer programming and Gantt diagram. 

***Final Grade*** :
