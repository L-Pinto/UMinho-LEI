### :pushpin: Software Development Systems 

***About*** : In this project we developed the stock management system component of a factory warehouse. During the Requirements Analysis and Conceptual Modeling of the Solution, we used *Visual Paradigm* for **UML** design of diagrams and models. Consequently, the Implementation of the solution followed **object-oriented** technologies using *Java*. The architectural design followed a **multilayer structure** (MVC).

***Final Grade*** : 15
