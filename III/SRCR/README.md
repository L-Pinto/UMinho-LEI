### :pushpin: Knowledge and Reasoning Representation Systems

***About*** : Both projects were developed in prolog using logic programming.
  - The group project consisted in developing a program that implements several features that allows the user to access information about Covid-19 vaccination in Portugal.
  - The individual project consisted in implementing search algorithms to determine the several paths that a garbage truck needs to travel to collect all the garbage in Lisbon. In addition, it includes specific information about each path, such as : kilometers traveled, types of garbage collected, kilograms of garbage collected, number and name of the visited locations, etc ... among other relevant features.
